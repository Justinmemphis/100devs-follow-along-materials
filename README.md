<h1>100Devs Follow-Along Materials: </h1>

<p>This is where I store the code I make while following along with 100Devs live class material. Course taught by Leon Noel.  Link to the course <a href="https://leonnoel.com/100devs/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Tech used: HTML</p>
<p>I'll be updating this as I go through the class.</p>
<h2>Optimizations:</h2>
<p>At some points I'm using slightly different methods than Leon.  For example, I'm using vi as my code editor (instead of VS Code like Leon), so I end up with slightly different spacing, etc.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>This is a refresher course for me, but I'm learning a lot of details that I wouldn't have learned otherwise.</p>
